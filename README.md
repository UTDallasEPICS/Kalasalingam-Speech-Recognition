## Current Status: 

Future Semester Work: 

- Test other models depending on budget to enhance current model
- Implement more functions
- Expand to various applications on computer besides Notepad/TextEdit
- Error handling
- Develop a front-end for application​
- Packaging the application into an .exe file to run it easier and quicker​



Miscellaneous:

- Users of the application should use mic and headset to prevent background noise from interfering
- When testing locally use the smaller Vosk models
