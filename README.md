# Kalasalingam-Speech-Recognition


# Project Description: 

Work concurrently with Kalasalingam Academy to build a speech module that allows people with spinal cord injuries to use a computer effectively. ​We are building a speech module that allows users to operatae certain applications with voice commands.


# Setup:

- Use any version of Python 3.11
- Download 40M and 2.3 GB Vosk models from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
- Utilize the requirements.txt to install all the necessary models
- Make sure to specify your specific file path for the model you're using and Application path file



## Current Status: 

Future Semester Work: 

- Test other models depending on budget to enhance current model
- Implement more functions
- Expand to various applications on computer besides Notepad/TextEdit
- Error handling
- Develop a front-end for application​
- Packaging the application into an .exe file to run it easier and quicker​



Miscellaneous:

- Users of the application should use mic and headset to prevent background noise from interfering
- When testing locally use the smaller Vosk models
